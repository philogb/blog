So I just moved from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a Ruby based static site generator. 
Moving from WordPress wasn't as pleasant as I thought, and the site might have some "bugs" (let me know if you find one!) 
but I'm much more happy to be writing this post in my favorite editor, and not having to rely on WordPress, PHP or MySQL to run the blog.

While moving stuff from WordPress I found a few interesting old posts, I hope you find them interesting too:

 - [Memoization in JavaScript](/2008/09/05/memoization-in-javascript/)
 - [Generic functions and JavaScript](/2009/02/08/generic-functions-and-javascript/)
 - [Sharp Variables](/2009/03/24/sharp-variables/)
 - [Interactive Visualization of genealogical graphs video](/2009/05/11/interactive-visualization-of-genealogical-graphs/)

...oh well, there are more interesting posts, so I recommend you to go to the [main page](/) to see a list of them. 

If you find some bugs please let me know!
