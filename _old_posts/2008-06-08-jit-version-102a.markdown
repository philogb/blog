Just dropping by to say I just released <a href="/blog/assets/jit.zip" target="_blank">version 1.0.2a</a> of the javascript infovis toolkit. You can also download it from the <a href="http://thejit.org">main page</a>.<br />
It fixes some known bugs on the Spacetree and Hyperbolic Tree visualizations.<br />
I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.opencrx.org/">OpenCRX</a> and Charles D. Aylward for pointing those errors out.<br />
I also used version 1.4 of Natural Docs to make the docs. <br />
Please let me know if you find more errors.<br />
Bye! :)
