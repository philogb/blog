While taking a look at some of the talks by Tamara Munzner I found this video/documentary about turning a sphere inside out. 
I've found this to be very impressive (and pedagogic). The style of the video reminds me the <a href="/2008/10/14/the-moebius-transformation/">Moebius Transformation video</a> I posted last year.

For those who don't know Tamara Munzner she's like a big reference in all InfoVis-related stuff. One of the most inspiring InfoVis talks I've found was done by her and can be seen <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6229232330597040086">here</a>. This is the talk that started my interest in InfoVis and the making of the <a href="http://thejit.org" target="_blank">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit</a>.
