Just a quick post to tell you that I've been selected to speak at <a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConf.eu 2010</a> in Berlin in September. <a href="http://jsconf.eu">JSConf.eu</a> is the most important JavaScript conference held in Europe. <a href="http://jsconf.eu/2009/speakers.html">Last year speakers</a> included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig">John Resig</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas Crockford</a> and <a href="http://280north.com/">280 north people</a> among others. I'm very excited about this event and I can't wait to meet everyone there!
