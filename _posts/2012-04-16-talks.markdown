I'll be giving a couple of talks related to data visualization,
JavaScript and Web standards in the next couple of weeks:

* Apr. 20 - Tech Talk on Data Visualization and Web Standards at
  [Stanford ACM](http://stanfordacm.com/). It's free and open to the
public so if you're around please come and say hi!

* May 19  - I'll be at [JSConf Argentina](http://jsconf.com.ar) with a
  more WebGL / JavaScript focused talk. I'm really excited to be
presenting in my country again, last time I presented it was at
Microsoft for [BarCamp BA](http://barcamp.com.ar/) like six years ago!

I hope to see you there!
