Last night I presented at the [data visualization meetup at Twitter HQs](http://www.meetup.com/visualizemydata/events/141900982/).
It was really awesome to meet the people there and nerd-out about visualization related things.

You can find the slids for my presentation [here](http://www.slideshare.net/philogb/interactives-at-twitter-27259565). Also the video is here:

The presentation was mostly about the process of releasing public-facing
data visualizations at Twitter, and also some analysis on one project
we're currently working on called Laika.

##\#interactive

Some of the examples I've shown are interactives that complement a
story. For example I presented about [Twitter's biggest moments](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/behind-the-numbers-how-to-understand-big-moments-on-twitter)

and also about our last [Emmys visualization](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/visualizing-tweets-around-emmy-nominated-shows).

In the presentation I explained that these projects are generally done
within the week (sometimes even in less time). The ratio of time invested vs. amount of engagement is
high, so it's a strategy that currently works for us.

##Laika

Laika is a data visualization showing geolocated activity on Twitter
around the world. The first iteration of the project was done during
hackweek. We had great feedback from people in the office so per
request the project turned into a live visual that is currently shown in the
displays around the Twitter HQs.

The main view shows a globe view, with day and night textures,
displaying geolocated Tweets and relevant Tweets around news (in the top
part). Click play to watch the short video.

Within this globe view we can focus on a particular city and fetch a
timeline of relevant Tweets happening there. Click below to watch the
short transition.

Although people like the globe view, this view hides 50%
of what's happening in the world at each moment. We added an unfolding
of the globe into a plane for this. Click play below to watch the short
video.

Following the "Overview, zoom and filter" mantra you can focus in a city
to get relevant Tweets of what's happening there along with news of that
city.
