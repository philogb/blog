I thought I'd put my schedule for the upcoming talks here so I can
convince whoever is reading this blog to come and meet me at some of
these events! :)

I'll be speaking at:

 * [Data Visualization Group in Bay Area](http://www.meetup.com/VisualizeMyData/events/32382432/) 
on New Tools for Visualization in JavaScript.

 * [Visual.ly Data Visualization Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Visual-ly-Data-Visualization-Meetup/events/30601541/) 
on The Ingredients of a Great Data Visualization.

 * [Tech Talks at Mozilla](http://functionsource.com/post/next-tech-talks-october-19-at-mozilla) 
on PhiloGL and its API.

 * [SenchaCon 2011 in Austin, TX](http://secure.lenos.com/lenos/sencha/SenchaCon2011/sessions.htm) 
on WebGL fundamentals.

I hope to see you there!
