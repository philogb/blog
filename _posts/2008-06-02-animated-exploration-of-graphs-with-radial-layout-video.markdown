I ran into this youtube video that presents all the features to be included in the RGraph visualization. Some of them were mentioned in the previous post (polar interpolation, child ordering), other are already included with the library (the first animation constraint mentioned in the video, ease-in and ease-out transitions, etc). Anyway, I thought this could be interesting.<br />
