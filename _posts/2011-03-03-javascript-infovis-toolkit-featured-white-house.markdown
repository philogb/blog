I was surprised when I entered the main [White House website](http://whitehouse.gov/) the other day to find out 
that this logo was showing a very familiar treemap.

Clicking on the logo took me to another page where this treemap was featured. The application / visualization showing the 2012 budget 
is made with a TreeMap, in JavaScript, using the [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/). Click [on this link](http://www.whitehouse.gov/winning-the-future/interactive-budget) to go to the White House page that features the visualization.
