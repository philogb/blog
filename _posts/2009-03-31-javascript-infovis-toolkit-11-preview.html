In case you're wondering what I'm up to...

I've been adding more features to the <a href="http://thejit.org">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit</a>, to be released I-don't-know-when-yet (still a lot of work to do regarding documentation, hosting, scripts, etc.).

Anyway, this video shows only some of the features to be included:

<ul>
<li>Custom nodes: built-in shapes are <em>none, circle, square, rectangle, ellipse</em>, among others</li>
<li>Custom edges: built-in shapes are <em>none, line, quadratic, bezier, arrow</em>, among others</li>
<li>Custom Animations: linear, Quart, Bounce, Elastic, Back, etc.</li>
<li>Change tree orientation: already possible in 1.0.8a.</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately my video card isn't very good, so the video quality and fps aren't as good as I'd wanted.
Animations are pretty smooth though, <a href="/blog/assets/jit-1.0a/examples/spacetree.html">as you can see for yourself</a>, so don't blame the library, blame my computer!

Anyway, here's the video:

<object width="500" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/51zW0EWEjHw&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/51zW0EWEjHw&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="385"></embed></object>

Another cool thing is that you can also create custom node and edge rendering functions :)

Stay tuned, there are more features to come!
