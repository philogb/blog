Just a quick post to tell you that I've been invited to speak at <a href="http://www.yowconference.com.au/">YOW! Australia Developer Conference</a> in Brisbane and Melbourne in December. YOW! is the new name for the <a href="http://jaoo.dk/">JAOO</a> (a.k.a Java and OO) conferences that have been running for over 13 years around the world already. <a href="http://www.yowconference.com.au/">YOW! Australia 2010</a> will include talks by <a href="http://www.yowconference.com.au/brisbane/speakers/details.html?speakerId=1616">Guy L. Steele, Jr.</a>, <a href="http://www.yowconference.com.au/brisbane/speakers/details.html?speakerId=1635">Erik Meijer</a> and me among others -yes, I can't believe I just put myself in the same list as these people!.

Anyway, I'll keep you updated.
