I worked on a data visualization for the 2012 European football
champioship at Twitter that you can find
[here](https://euro2012.twitter.com).

The visualization shows day-by-day data aggregated by country but also
shows tweets per minute for each match of the tournament.

I made some tweaks to the [JavaScript InfoVis
Toolkit](http://thejit.org/) to create the StreamGraph visualization.
During the process I made some mistakes that ended up in curious
pseudo-visualizations like this ScribbleGraph:

Or like this ScatteredFeatherGraph:

Or even this Windows solitaire tribute graph:

I'm thinking on writing a paper about these (not).
