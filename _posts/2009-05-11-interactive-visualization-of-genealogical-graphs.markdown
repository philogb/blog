It's been a while since I last bumped into a nice visualization project like this one.
It offers an advanced interface for exploring Genealogical graphs.

I personally like how nodes are hidden/shown in demand, how the subtree widget is implemented and how you can easily switch between different layouts.

On a side note, I've been screencasting the artist/band visualization project I made some time ago with the <a href="http://thejit.org">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit</a>, hope you find it interesting: it shows relations between artists and bands by collaborations in albums/songs/bands, etc.

<b>You can access a live example <a href="http://demos.thejit.org/example/hypertree/example1/" target="_blank">here</a></b>. I think its better rendered with Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome 2 (version 1.0.x has a <A href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=3620">bug</a>).

The <b>left menu</b> offers some navigation options to choose a band as starting point. You can also find <b>details</b> about the focused band under the <b>Details toggler</b>.

Here's a short video of what you should be able to see:
