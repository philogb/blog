I've been quite busy these days. 

I've been answering questions at the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/javascript-information-visualization-toolkit">JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit Google Group</a>, fixing a couple of bugs for the <a href="http://thejit.org">JIT</a> and putting a lot of effort in <a href="http://github.com/philogb/v8-gl/tree/master/#readme">V8-GL</a>.

Oh right, I was almost forgetting that I have a day job also :S

Anyway, V8-GL kind of took another direction. I've been working on OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL 2.1 bindings. 

OpenGL ES 2.0 bindings are almost complete. Other bindings (like OpenGL 2.1, GLUT and GLU) need some extra work, but they are functional.

[Dean](http://github.com/deanm) helped a lot also. He just translated <a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/2007/11/26/canvas-3d-gl-power-web-style/">Vlad's</a> metatunnel example to work with the new OpenGL ES 2.0 bindings. 

The result's pretty impressive:

You can find some videos of "Metatunnel" implemented in Processing or Canvas3D at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qryxLDujyVk">Youtube</a>. 

The good thing about the <em>V8-GL example</em> is that's a Desktop app coded in JavaScript using V8.
