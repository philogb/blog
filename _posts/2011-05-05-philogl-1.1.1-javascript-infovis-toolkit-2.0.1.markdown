Just a quick post to let you know about two patch releases for the
[JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/) and [PhiloGL](http://senchalabs.github.com/philogl/)
respectively.

### JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit 2.0.1

The new patch release for the [JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit](http://thejit.org/) includes many
bug fixes (that you can find [here](https://github.com/philogb/jit/commits/master)) and new 
configuration options for Area, Pie and Bar charts.

As I mentioned before I'm very excited that the project has been selected for the [Google Summer of
Code 2011 program](http://code.google.com/soc/), and that two student applications have been already accepted. 
The selected students will work on 
making the toolkit better by implementing new visualizations like
Voronoi TreeMaps, Scatter Charts, Line Charts and other work related to code design and refactoring. Expect some 
interesting updates on the project in the next few months!

### PhiloGL 1.1.1

[PhiloGL](http://senchalabs.github.com/philogl/) version 1.1.1 has been
released with a bunch of bug fixes and improvements. Multiple point
lights (up to 50) are supported now. You can check a complete 
changelog [here](https://github.com/senchalabs/philogl/commit/b74faf71a663f4be14618ff4721a66d8ca8b7af3).
