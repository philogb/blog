A couple of weeks ago -before the 1.0.7a release- I got an e-mail from Fanbin Kong, a <a href="http://platform.com">Platform Computing</a> software developer, reporting a few bugs on the <a href="http://thejit.org/#treemaps">Treemap</a> visualization.
These bugs mainly had to do with memory leaks and rendering performance.
Together with Fanbin Kong and Yi Zheng we tried to fix these bugs, and came up with a new algorithm that increases rendering performance and solves (almost) all memory leak issues.
The changes were applied on version 1.0.7a of the <a href="http://thejit.org">JavaScript Infovis Tookit</a>.

The other good news is that they gave me an ipod touch for this!

<img style="border: 1px solid orange; width:400px; padding: 3px; margin: 5px 13px 45px 0; float: left;" src="/blog/assets/static/img/ipod.JPG" alt="ipod" title="The library works pretty well on safari mobile too :)" />
<div style="clear:both"></div>

They also wrote an inscription at the back of the ipod: "Appreciation to Nico. A gift from Platform".

Thanks a lot guys, it really feels good to know that you appreciate my work :)
